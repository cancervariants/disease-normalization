The CS3R T618I mutation has been associated with response to JAK2 inhibitors but not dasatinib.  A germline activating CSF3R mutation (p. T617N) has been described in autosomal dominant hereditary neutrophilia associated with splenomegaly and increased circulating CD34-positive myeloid progenitors.  Nonsense and/or frameshift somatic mutations truncating the cytoplasmic domain of CSF3R have been described in approximately 40% of patients with severe congenital neutropenia and in the context of mutations in other genes may be associated with  progression to acute myeloid leukemia.  These activating truncating mutations have also been found in patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia or atypical chronic myeloid leukemia. Some of these cytoplasmic truncating mutations have been associated with responses to dasatinib but not JAK2 inhibitors.",

Almost all WM patients with mutation of CXCR4 also carry the MYD88 L265P mutation.  Mutations in CXCR4 appear to be mutually exclusive of mutations in CD79A/CD79B.

        "description": "SF3B1 encodes a core component of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, involved in the recognition of the branchpoint sequence during RNA splicing.  SF3B1 is one of several genes involved in RNA splicing that has been identified as recurrently mutated in MDS and other malignancies.  SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated gene found in MDS (20-33% of MDS overall).  SF3B1 mutations are highly associated with subtypes of MDS characterized by ring sideroblasts (MDS with ring sideroblasts and MDS with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts), present in ~80% of these patients. In addition, many cases (60-80%) of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblast and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T) harbor SF3B1 mutations.  SF3B1 mutations are also found in 12% of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, 4-7% of primary myelofibrosis, 5% of CMML, less than 5% of de novo AML and less than 5% of essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera.  SF3B1 mutations tend to occur in exons 13-16 and appear to be enriched at codons Lys700, Lys666, His662, Arg625 and Glu622. Missense mutations have been reported in approximately 5-10% of cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and are reported to be associated with del11q , unmutated IGHV and may predict an adverse prognosis in CLL. Mutations in splicing factor components are usually mutually exclusive. Among cases of CLL, SF3B1 mutations tend to be exclusive of NOTCH1 mutations according to one study. The presence of SF3B1 mutation has been included in the diagnostic criteria for MDS/MPN-RS-T and MDS-RS diagnosis in the 2016 revision of the WHO classification. SF3B1 mutations are independently associated with a more favorable prognosis in MDS (NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes) and are highly predictive for the presence of ring sideroblasts. SF3B1 mutations are also reported to be highly specific for secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and may also be helpful in identifying a subset of therapy-related AML or elderly patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia with worse clinical outcomes. SF3B1 mutations are associated with an unfavorable prognosis in essential thrombocythemia.  SF3B1 has a critical role in MDS by affecting the expression and splicing of genes involved in specific cellular processes/pathways, many of which are relevant to the known MDS-RS pathophysiology, suggesting a causal link.",

        "description": "Beta catenin is a transcriptional co-regulator and an adapter protein for cellular adhesion; it comprises part of the Wnt signaling pathway and intracellular levels of beta-catenin are regulated by its phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation.  Accumulation of nuclear beta catenin can lead to a tumoral phenotype and oncogenic transformation in a variety of solid tumors.  Various oncogenic mutants of beta catenin have been found in different tumor types which alter its degradation, leading to its accumulation and promoting tumor growth.  Some of these mutations are located at the N-terminus of the protein at the sites of phosphorylation which normally regulate its degradation.  Interestingly, in a recent study, 38% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukaemia, showed increased \u03b2-catenin signalling and nuclear accumulation of beta catenin in osteoblasts  was associated with increased Notch signalling in haematopoietic cells consistent with a model where abnormalities of osteolineage cells are associated with myeloid malignancies. In addition, aberrant Wnt siganling has been reported to play a role in chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-hodgkin lymphomas.  Inhibition of beta catenin using small molecule inhibitors is currently being investigated in various tumor types.  Recent studies suggest that targeting of the Wnt pathway and beta catenin may be promising targets in the therapy of acute myeloid leukemia.",

The p.E1099K mutation appears to be less prevalent in other types of B-ALL(less than 5%) and both mutations appear to be absent in T-ALL, pediatric AML and adult ALL.   In experimental models, increased H3K36 dimethylation and decreased unmodified H3K36 was associated with the NSD2 p.E1099K variant or the t(4;14) translocation( which leads to overexpression of NSD2).  Overexpression of NSD2 in t(4;14)-positive multiple myeloma (MM) is also associated with globally increased levels of H3K36 dimethylation and decreased K27 trimethylation. NSD2 is considered to be a potential therapeutic target for a subset of cases of pediatric B-ALL.",

TET2 is a tumor suppressor gene and loss-of-function via mutations, deletion and IDH1/2 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 and 2) gene mutations is a common event in myeloid and lymphoid malignancies.  TET2 is also present in about 10% of otherwise healthy elderly individuals with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and in some patients with unexplained cytopenia but who do not satisfy diagnostic criteria for MDS, so-called clonal cytopenia with undetermined significance (CCUS).  Mutations in TET2 occur in 50-60% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemias. Comutation of TET2 and SRSF2 was highly predictive of a myeloid neoplasm characterized by myelodysplasia and monocytosis, including but not limited to, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.  TET2 mutations are also found in 20-40% of systemic mastocytosis, 36% of blastic plasamcytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, 12-32% of acute myeloid leukemia, 10-20% of primary myelofibrosis, 10-33% of myelodysplastic syndromes, 10% of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN-RS-T),  22% of polycythemia vera, and 16% of essential thrombocythemia. TET2 mutations are absent in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and show a low prevalence (less than 5%) in pediatric AML. Among lymphoid neoplasms, TET2 mutations are reported in approximately 30% of angioimmunoblastic lymphomas and less than 15 % of other mature T cell lymphomas and mature B cell lymphomas. In general, the mutations in TET2 are typically loss of function variants (frameshift, missense, nonsense mutations) that may be monoallelic or biallelic and occur throughout the gene. TET2 mutations tend to be mutually exclusive of mutations in IDH1/IDH2. TET2 mutations are associated with unfavorable outcomes and shorter survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (PMID: 25092778). In acute myeloid leukemia with wild-type FLT3-ITD and normal karyotype or intermediate-risk cytogenetic abnormalities, TET2 mutations are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.",

This variant is associated with enhanced activation of downstream signaling including NF-\u03baB activity.  TLR2 p.F217S may be associated with a higher frequency of chromosome 7 deletion in MDS as well.  It is important to note that the TLR2 p.F217S  variant has not been clearly established as a somatic variant and it is reported in the ESP database with an overall allele frequency  of approximatly 0.3%.

PIM1 expression appears to be up-regulated by STAT5, and has been found to be over-expressed in primary AML blast samples.  In particular, PIM1 has associated with FLT3 mediated leukemogenesis in FLT3-ITD AML. PIM1 expression was noted to be 25-fold higher than in FLT3-ITD samples, as compared to wild type FLT3 (WT) AML samples.  The PIM kinases, therefore, represent potential therapeutic targets in AML, particularly in those cases harboring FLT3-ITD mutations.  According to one study, the small molecule inhibitor of PIM1, AR00459339, alone and in combination with a FLT3 inhibitor (AR00454200), resulted in significant cytotoxicity in FLT3-ITD cell lines and patient samples that strikingly parallels the effects of FLT3 inhibition.  A variety of mutations have been reported throughout PIM1 in various types of malignancy including hematopoietic tumors, but PIM1 mutations appear to be extremely rare in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplasia.",

Mutations of B-RAF have been described in up to 100% of Hairy cell leukemia, 40-70% of  Langerhans cell histiocytosis, approximately 50% of Erdheim-Chester disease,  approximately 5% of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and plasma cell neoplasms and less than 5% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  While some reports have found that 10-20% of cases of acute leukemias (ALL or AML) may have BRAF mutations, other reports have described no BRAF in those diseases or in myeloid diseases such as MDS or CML. The hotspot for mutations in BRAF is at codon Val600 and these are activating mutations.  The most common activating mutation is p.Val600Glu(V600E).  Various B-Raf inhibitors(Vemurafenib, Dabrafenib) have been FDA approved for therapy for some tumor types in certain clinical settings.",

Notch signaling regulates cell fate decisions during development, and plays a crucial role in T cell development. Activating mutations of NOTCH1 including missense mutations and inframe inserstions/deletions in the heterodimerization(HD) domains either alone or together with missense, nonsense or frameshift (in/del) mutations in the C terminal PEST domain have been described in approximately 50% of cases of T-ALL. The HD domain or PEST domain mutations may occur together in cis (on the same allele) in ALL. NOTCH1 mutations are very rare in AML. However, NOTCH1 mutations are present in about 27% patients with T-myeloid mixed-phenotypeacute leukemia. The potential utility of therapeutic targeting of activating NOTCH1 mutations in these diseases remains to be elucidated.",

Activating mutations of NT5C2 have been reported in 19%of  relapsed T cell ALLs and 3-10% of relapsed B-precursor ALLs.

The precise roles of WT1 in normal and malignant hematopoiesis remain uncertain.  New emerging supports a novel role of WT1 in the regulation of epigenetic programs through its interaction with TET proteins in the 5=hydroxymethylation of cytosines. WT1 mutations are found in 6% of acute myeloid leukemia overall, and about 8-13% in cytogenetically normal AML. Higher frequencies are present in biallelic CEBPA mutated acute myeloid leukemia (14%), followed by t(15;17)/PML-RARA (11.0%), and FLT3-ITD (8.5%,).  WT1 mutations are associated with younger age in AML. WT1 mutations are typically putative loss of function mutations and most frequently occur in exon 7 or exon 9.  About 75% of these mutations are frameshift, and the remaining are missense, nonsense, splice site or inframe indel mutations. In some cases two or more mutations in WT1 may occur. In addition, WT1 mutations may coexist with mutations in NPM1, FLT3, among others. WT1 is overexpressed in the majority of AML, giving rise to the concept that it may act as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene, depending on the context.  Several studies showed that WT1 mutations are associated with a worse prognosis in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia, although one study including patients from three German-Austrian AML study protocols demonstrated no association with overall survival or relapse-free survival.  Given its over-expression in AML, clinical trials employing peptide vaccination strategy against WT1 has been ongoing in AML patients.",

ATM genetic abnormalities include deletions and mutations which may occur alone or together.  ATM mutations have been reported to occur in approximately 35% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia; biallelic ATM inactivation (deletions and mutations) are associated with a poor outcome in some setttings compared to monoallelic ATM deletion or mutation in CLL. The ATM mutations occur throughout the gene and are putative loss of function variants (missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations).  ATM mutations have also been reported in other types of lymphoma including mantle cell lymphoma (50%) and T cell prolymphocytic leukemia (46%).",

Also, CBL mutations are found in only 1% of de novo acute leukemias and tend to be associated with core binding factor acute myeloid leukemia (AML) among AML cases. CBL is a Ras pathway gene and has been associated with hereditary myeloid disorders. CBL ubiquitinylates and degrades activated receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases via the E3-ligase activity of its RING domain. CBL also acts as an adaptor for downstream cell signal transduction, via its tyrosine kinase binding domain. Most variants of the CBL protein are missense substitutions in the zinc binding RING domain (amino acids 366-420) (exons 8-9) that abrogate CBL ubiquitin ligase activity but retain other functions.  Pathogenic mutations are believed to be oncogenic by a variety of potential mechanisms including increased Ras pathway activation, aberrant phosphoSTAT5 and/or increased KIT expression in different cellular contexts.  Occasionally, two CBL mutations may be present or CBL mutations may be associated with uniparental disomy.  In addition, CBL mutations may occur together with mutations in other genes ( RUNX1, ASXL1, TET2 or EZH2 ).  According to some studies, mutations of CBL may be associated with reduced overall survival in MDS.",

Within cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, mutations of PTPN11 tend to be exclusive of mutations in RAS, CBL and NF-1.  PTPN11 mutations in adult AML are associated with a normal karyotype and concurrent NPM1 mutation, but no alteration of the FLT3.  In one study, myelodysplastic syndromes with PTPN11 mutations were shown to have a worse overall survival.  Small molecule inhibitors of PTPN11 are currently being developed.",

        "description": "FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase important in hematopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation.  In-frame, FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD), which show a wide range of number of nucleotides duplicated and/or inserted (eg, 18-204 bp), affect exons 14 and 15 in the FLT3 juxtamembrane/tyrosine kinase domain and have been reported in 20-30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia.  FLT3 ITDs usually occur in cases of AML with a normal karyotype and but may also occur in cases with chromosome abnormalities including t(15;17) or other cytogenetic groups.  Individuals with FLT3 mutations are more likely to have AML than MDS and FLT3 mutations in MDS are associated with a poor prognosis.  Functional studies have shown that FLT3 ITDs are ligand-independent, gain-of-function mutations.  In addition, activating mutations at codon D835 in exon 20 (A-loop of the tyrosine kinase domain, TKD) of FLT3 have been reported in approximately 7-10% of AML. The FLT3 D835 mutations are also ligand-independent, gain-of-function mutations.  FLT3 ITD and D835 mutations tend to occur in a mutually exclusive manner; however, the FLT3 D835 mutation or other mutations in the A-loop(eg, D839, Y842) may occur as an acquired resistance mutation in the setting of patients with FLT3 ITD mutations being treated with targeted therapy. In addition, variants at codon N676 and in exon 17 F691, G697 have been associated with resistance to FLT3 targeted therapy.   The presence of FLT3 ITD mutation in young patients with AML and normal cytogenetics is thought to be associated with a poor prognosis.  On the other hand, the prognostic significance of the FLT3 D835 and TKD mutations appears less clear.  More recently, therapeutic targeting of FLT3 in combination with other chemotherapy is available in certain settings for acute myeloid leukemia with FLT3 ITD or TKD mutations.   Lastly, in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, up to 20% of cases have been reported to show a FLT3 mutation (TKD or ITD) and are often associated with an ETP(early T cell precursor) phenotype.  In addition, FLT3 mutations have also been reported in up to 15% of B-ALL cases (\"Ph-like phenotype\") and may also be associated with hyperdiploidy and MLL rearrangement. Targetting FLT3 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy may also be possible in some settings.",

SRSF2 mutations have been reported in approximately 40% of cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, but they may not have prognostic significance in that entity. Comutation of TET2 and SRSF2 was highly predictive of a myeloid neoplasm characterized by myelodysplasia and monocytosis, including but not limited to, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.  In addition, SRSF2 mutations have been reported in approximately 15-20% of cases of myelodysplastic syndrome.  SRSF2 mutations have also been described in 5-20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and appear to be enriched among AML patients with reduced blast counts. SRSF2 has been found to be mutated in approximately 10% of cases of primary myelofibrosis where mutations may occur together with mutations in JAK2, MPL, TET2, CBL, ASXL1, EZH2, IDH1/2.   SRSF2 mutations are also present in 8% of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm and 3% of polythemia vera. SRSF2 mutations tend to be (although are not entirely) exclusive of mutations in other splicing factor components.

        "description": "SETBP1 encodes a protein which is believed to inhibit PP2A phosphatase activity through SET stabilization. In addition, SETBP1 binds to gDNA in AT-rich promoter regions, causing activation of a network of development genes through recruitment of a HCF1/KMT2A/PHF8 epigenetic complex. Heterozygous, somatic, missense mutations are predominantly hot-spot mutations within the SKI homologous region in exon 4, which result in the functional loss of the degron motif responsible for the short half-life of the protein. Therefore, these mutations result in an increased half-life and accumulation of the mutated SETBP1, and thus increased inhibition of the oncosupressor PP2A through the SETBP1-SET-PP2A axis.  In addition, mutations in SETBP1 potentially deregulate gene transcription mediated by SETBP1.  SETBP1 mutations have been described in approximately 25% of atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia, 30% of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, 17% of secondary acute myeloid leukemia, 13% of myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic syndrome with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis, and 5-15% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.  SETPB1 mutations appear to be rare (< 5%) or absent among cases of primary acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, myeloproliferative neoplasms and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  SETBP1 mutations may be seen together with mutations in other genes such as ASXL1.  Mutated SETBP1 provides supportive evidence for the diagnosis of atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL1-negative in the 2016 revision of the WHO classification.SETBP1 mutations are associated with disease progression in myelodysplastic syndrome (NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes), and unfavorable prognosis in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, and MDS/MPN with ring sideroblasts associated and thrombocytosis.",

CEBPA plays a role in the differentiation of granulocytes. Two types of mutations have been reported: N-terminal changes which result in a truncated dominant negative isoform lacking one of the N terminal domain transactivation domains and C-terminal mutations which are in-frame insertions or deletions affecting the leucine zipper and preventing dimerization and DNA binding. Patients may carry both N- and C-terminal mutations affecting different alleles.  Isolated, biallelic (\"double\") mutations (not single mutation) of CEBPA appear to be associated with a favorable-risk group of normal karyotype AML.

AML with RUNX1 mutation which does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for other specific AML subtypes in the categories of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes is now classified the provisional entity of AML with mutated RUNX1. RUNX1 mutations may be associated with Trisomy 8 or MLL-PTD in AML according to some studies. They tend not to occur in AML cases with favorable cytogenetic findings and appear to be exclusive of NPM1 or CEBPA mutations in AML. Myeloid neoplasms, predominantly MDS/AML, developing in patients, usually at a young age, with a familial platelet disorder and germline monoallelic RUNX1 mutations are categorized as myeloid neoplasms with germline RUNX1 mutation.  Of note, RUNX1 may also be involved in large intragenic deletions and translocations (e.g., t(8;21)(RUNX1-ETO), t(3;21)(RUNX1-EVI1), t(12;21)(TEL-RUNX1) which are not detected by this assay. \n\nMutated RUNX1 is a poor-risk prognostic marker in AML unless it co-occurs with favorable-risk AML subtypes (NCCN Guidelines for AML).  RUNX1 nonsense or frameshift mutations are associated with an unfavorable prognosis in myelodysplastic syndrome, independent of IPSS, IPSS-R, age, and other gene mutations (NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes).  RUNX1 mutations are independently associated with unfavorable outcomes and shorter survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia.

U2AF1 is one of several spliceosome complex genes frequently mutated in a variety of hematologic malignancies. Two hotspot mutations (S34 in exon 2 and Q157 in exon 6) occur within the two zinc-finger domains of the U2AF1 protein. These mutations have been reported in approximately 4- 9% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia,  8-11% of cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (typically without ring sideroblasts), 16% of primary myelofibrosis, 12% of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, 4% of acute myeloid leukemia and 1% of essential thrombocythemia.  U2AF1 mutations are associated with an unfavorable prognosis in myelodysplastic syndrome (NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes) and essential thrombocythemia, and decreased response to lenalidomide in myeloid neoplasms with and without del(5q). U2AF1 mutations are also reported to be highly specific for secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and may also be helpful in identifying a subset of therapy-related AML or elderly de novo AML with worse clinical outcomes.  U2AF1 mutations have been associated with altered splicing patterns in vitro and in vivo, and may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies due to selective mis-splicing of tumor-associated genes.",

Amino-terminal, small insertion/deletion(frameshift), nonsense and missense mutations of GATA1 have been described in almost all patients with transient abnormal myelopoiesis(TAM) and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia associated with Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)(DS-AMKL). Studies suggest that the cases of TAM which progress to DS-AMKL are associated with the acquisition of additional driver mutations in other genes including the cohesin complex genes as well as CTCF and EZH2.  The amino-terminal GATA1 mutations lead to a lack of the N-terminal amino acids and translation from an alternate start codon (methionine at position 84 in exon 3).  GATA1 mutations appear to be rare in acute megakaryoblastic leukemia not associated with Down syndrome. GATA1 mutations have also been reported in the context of hereditary myeloid disorders.  If clinical findings and family history are concerning for an inherited disorder, then genetic counseling may be helpful, if clinically indicated.",

In addition, CALR mutations have been reported in approximately 10% of patients with myelodysplasia, including JAK2/MPL-negative refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS-T) where it may co-occur with mutations in SF3B1.  In ET, PMF, and RARS-T, calreticulin mutations appear to be mutually exclusive of mutations in JAK2 or MPL.  The CALR mutations lead to loss of the endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (KDEL) sequence in the carboxy-terminal portion of mutant CALR. Calreticulin mutations appear to be absent in polycythemia vera, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, systemic mastocytosis, lymphoid malignancies and are rare in atypical chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The most common 52bp deletion mutation (Type 1) in CALR has been shown to lead to cytokine-independent growth and activation of STAT5.  Type 2 (5 bp insertion) mutations have also been described. This represents a potentially targettable pathway alteration.  Patients with some types of mutant CALR may show improved survival and lower risk of thrombosis compared to patients with mutant JAK2, according to some, but not all studies.",

        "description": "Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired hemolytic disorder that shows intravascular hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. Other clinical findings include thrombocytopenia  and/or leukocytopenia and recurrent venous thrombosis. PNH results from the expansion of an abnormal clone of hematopoietic stem cells harboring somatic mutation in phosphotidylinositol glycan complementation class A (PIGA) gene, which appears to have a survival advantage. The PIGA gene maps to Xp22.1; therefore only one allele of PIGA is transcribed in both sexes because of X inactivation. Pathogenic mutation results in a deficiency in the surface expression of all GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-AP) because of defective synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI).  In all reported cases of acquired PNH, the mutation is detected only in the PIGA gene.   PIGA germline mutations have been described in Multiple Congenital Anomalies-Hypotonia-Seizures Syndrome 2 . Pathogenic mutations in PIGA tend to be nonsense, frameshift and occasionally splice site and missense mutations occurring throughout the gene.  Detection of PNH clones by flow cytometry is done by studying the expression of GPI-AP on RBC and PB leukocytes using monoclonal antibodies specific for these proteins or by studying the GPI anchor itself, using FLAER.  Correlation with other clinical and lab findings as well as family history is recommended. Genetic counseling may be helpful, if clinically indicated.",

However, if a BRAF mutation is not detected, the tumor may either be sporadic or Lynch syndrome associated. Detection of BRAF mutations may also be useful in determining patient eligibility for anti-EGFR treatment. Approximately 8--15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors harbor BRAF mutations. The presence of BRAF mutation is significantly associated with right-sided colon cancers and is associated with decreased overall survival. Some studies have reported that patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) that harbor BRAF mutations do not respond to anti-EGFR antibody agents cetuximab or panitumumab in the chemotherapy-refractory setting.

Somatic gain-of-function mutations in CTNNB1 result in aberrant accumulation of the b-catenin protein and are prevalent in a wide range of solid tumors, including endometrial carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma, among others. Genetic alterations in CTNNB1 have been identified in 4% of non-small cell lung cancers. The CTNNB1 S45P mutation is likely oncogenic, but no real progress has been made in targeting oncogenic mutant forms of CTNNB1 in lung cancer. However, CTNNB1 mutation-positive cancers are presumed to be resistant to pharmacologic inhibition of upstream components of the WNT pathway, instead requiring direct inhibition of b-catenin function. In one study pharmacological inhibition of b-catenin suppressed EGFR-L858R/T790M mutated lung tumor and genetic deletion of the b-catenin gene dramatically reduced lung tumor formation in transgenic mice, suggesting that b-catenin plays an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and that targeting the b-catenin pathway may provide novel strategies to prevent lung cancer development or overcome resistance to EGFR TKIs. These results should be interpreted in the clinical context.",

        "description": "ERBB2 (also HER2) is a transmembrane receptor that is a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. ERBB2 is altered by amplification and/or overexpression in various cancers, most frequently in breast, esophagogastric and endometrial cancers. Somatic mutations in ERBB2 have been identified in a series of tumors including lobular breast, lung adenocarcinoma, and gastric cancers, among others, with recurrent hotspot alterations in both the extracellular and kinase domains. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that many of these mutations are transforming and sensitive to FDA-approved ERBB targeted therapies, including trastuzumab, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, lapatinib, and pertuzumab. The ERBB2 p.G776delinsVC variant is one of the in-frame insertions in exon 20 of ERBB2 that have been described in lung adenocarcinoma. Overall, in-frame ERRB2 insertions in exon 20 have been reported in approximately 6% of cases of lung adenocarcinoma which are negative for EGFR, KRAS, ALK alterations and these variants are more frequent in patients who were never-smokers. In vitro studies have shown that this specific variant is associated with constitutive kinase activation and is associated with sensitivity to some ERBB2 inhibitors and therefore, it may represent a targetable mutation in some clinical settings. Please refer to clinicaltrials.gov for additional information. Recommend correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings.",

Point mutations in codons 12 and 13 of RAS gene increases its affinity for GTP and those in codon 61 inactivate its autocatalytic GTPase function, resulting in permanent RAS activation and stimulation of its downstream targets along the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. In thyroid, RAS (HRAS, NRAS and KRAS) mutations are identified in 10--20% of papillary carcinomas, 40--50% of follicular carcinomas, 10% of medullary carcinomas, and 20--40% of poorly differentiated and anaplastic carcinomas. The frequency of HRAS mutations in thyroid carcinomas is approximately 4%. HRAS mutations at codon 61 have been reported in a variety of thyroid lesions and are especially prevalent in the follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma. However, the predictive or prognostic significance of HRAS mutation in thyroid carcinoma is not clear and correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is necessary.",

        "description": "KRAS is a gene that encodes one of the several proteins in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway that is important in the development and progression of cancer. KRAS can harbor oncogenic mutations that yield a constitutively active protein. Such mutations are found in approximately 30% to 50% of metastatic colorectal tumors and are common in other tumor types. Mutations in the KRAS gene may indicate poor prognosis and poor drug response with therapies targeted to EGFR. The absence of a KRAS mutation predicts a greater likelihood of response to EGFR-targeted therapies and improved survival with such treatment. The relevant KRAS mutation is in one of five codons (12 13, 61, 117 or 146). The presence of KRAS mutations in codon 12, 13 or 61 is associated with a high likelihood of resistance to therapies targeting EGFR. In addition, mutations at codons 117 and 146 may also be associated with reduced response to EGFR-targeted therapies.  Results should be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.\nDrug resistance: \nPanitumumab\nCetuximab",

        "description": "NRAS gene belongs to the family of RAS genes. It encodes a G protein that is important in the transmission of growth-promoting signals from the cell surface receptors to the nucleus through RAS-RAF- mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT cell signaling pathways. NRAS mutations are the most common type of RAS mutations in thyroid nodules. Activating point mutations in NRAS gene have been associated with follicular-patterned neoplasms including follicular adenoma, follicular carcinoma and follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma cases. NRAS mutations have been also detected in a subset of poorly differentiated carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma. NRAS mutations concentrate in codon 61, while those in codons 12 or 13 are rare. According to some studies, there is a significant correlation between RAS mutations and distant bone metastases among follicular and papillary carcinomas. However, RAS mutations are also frequently found in encapsulated follicular variant of papillary carcinoma, a tumor with an indolent behavior. Clinical correlation is recommended.",

PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene, and loss of PTEN results in upregulation of the PI3K/ AKT pathway. Loss of PTEN is most commonly due to promoter hypermethylation, while homozygous deletion and nonsense mutations with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) may also occur. PTEN mutations may occur in multiple exons. In preclinical studies, PTEN loss is associated with decreased sensitivity of EGFR mutant lung tumors to EGFR TKIs. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in PTEN loss are being explored.",

PBRM1 is likely a tumor suppressor because the reported mutations are mostly inactivating truncations.

The contribution of PBRM1 mutations to the clinical outcome of ccRCC patients has been controversial. Some groups reported that these mutations did not seem to correlate with adverse patient survival. However, other groups have reported that PBRM1mutations are positively linked to tumor invasiveness and, based on immunohistochemistry findings, loss of the PBRM1 protein was associated with advanced tumor stage, high Fuhrman grade, and poor overall survival.",

The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia-inducible-factor (HIF), which is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression by oxygen. Biallelic VHL gene defects (truncation and missense) occur in approximately 75% of ccRCC cases. In addition, approximately 19% of tumors show evidence of inactivation by methylation of the VHL gene promoter. Studies of VHL mutational status as a prognostic marker in advanced sporadic RCC have been inconsistent. However, recent studies with VEGF-inhibitors suggested that loss of function mutations in VHL were associated with treatment response. There are ongoing clinical trials using the current VEGF-tyrosine kinase inhibitors specifically in patients with vHL.  Correlation with clinical findings and genetic counseling may be helpful if there is clinical concern for an inherited cancer syndrome.

Upon SPOP mutation in prostate cancer, impaired ubiquitination of its substrates can lead to enhanced AR signaling and cell proliferation. Both AR and AR coactivators are substrates deregulated by SPOP mutation, providing a possible explanation for the associated increase in AR activity seen in this subtype of prostate cancers. SPOP mutations exclusively occur in ETS-negative group of prostate cancer. ERG ubiquitination is also regulated by SPOP. ERG fusion proteins evade SPOP-mediated degradation. This might explain the reason for mutual exclusivity of ETS fusion and SPOP mutation in prostate cancer and create a potential novel therapeutic avenue for ETS fusion tumors.\nSPOP mutant are significantly associated with CHD1 deletions at 5q21 or 6q21 regions. CHD1 gene controls the transcriptional activity across the genome. It is recurrently deleted in 10%-25% of primary and metastatic prostate cancer, and particularly focal homozygous deletions are restricted to ETS-negative tumors. The SPOP-mutant/CHD1-deleted subset of prostate cancer have characteristic molecular features, including high levels of DNA methylation, homogeneous gene expression patterns, distinct somatic copy-number alterations (SCNA), as well as frequent overexpression of SPINK1 mRNA. The latter is associated with aggressive disease and increased risk of biochemical recurrence.

Some studies have shown that the HGF expression in high-grade (WHO Grade III-IV) tumors was significantly higher than in low-grade (WHO I-II) tumors. Similarly, coexpression of HGF and MET is observed more frequently in Grade IV GBM than in low-grade glioma, consistent with the contribution of an HGF/MET autocrine loop to malignant progression in these tumors. However, MET sequence alterations have been rare. The p.T1010I mutation, in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain of MET has been reported in some tumor types and also has been reported as a germline variant present in less than 1% of the general population. Its role in tumor development and progression continues to be studied. The utility of MET pathway inhibitors also continues to be explored.",

APC promotes rapid degradation of beta-catenin and participates in Wnt signaling as a negative regulator. APC is also involved in other processes including cell migration, cell adhesion, transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Germline defects in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant pre-malignant disease that usually progresses to malignancy. Disease-associated mutations tend to be clustered in a small region designated the mutation cluster region (MCR) and result in a truncated protein product. Somatic mutations in this gene may be observed in colorectal cancer (CRC), stomach cancer and desmoid tumors. Although APC mutations have been reported in up to 5% of low grade gliomas and up to 13% primary glioblastomas (GBM), evidence regarding their involvement in CNS tumors is still limited.

The AR gene undergoes multiple alterations leading to increased activity in prostate cancer, including gene amplification, point mutations, and alteration in splicing leading to constitutively active variants.

It is believed that lesions in the AR gene itself do not play a role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, but instead emerge during treatment as a mechanism of resistance to therapies targeting the androgen axis. Even in advanced cancers that no longer respond to androgen deprivation therapy, accumulating evidence has shown that AR signaling remains active and plays a critical role in disease progression.

However, mutations affecting the coding region of the SMAD4 gene have been detected in some sporadic thyroid neoplasms.  Studies that analyzed expression of SMAD4 in thyroid tumors gave contradictory results. Some studies showed that the expression of SMAD4 was reduced in thyroid cancer cells. Other studies indicated that it was expressed and present in the nucleus in all thyroid cell lines and controls analyzed, indicating propagation of TGFB signaling in thyroid tumors.  Of note, a SMAD4 mutation C324Y, recently isolated from nodal metastases of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), was confirmed to cause an increase in TGFB signaling and lead to the acquisition of transformed phenotype and invasive behavior in thyroid cells, enabling them to proliferate independently from thyroid-stimulating hormone.",

It is known that some FGFR2 gene variations including intronic polymorphisms confer a risk for breast cancer, preferentially for estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors. FGFR2 and FGF10, the main ligand of FGFR2, are both overexpressed in 5-10% of breast tumors. Somatic missense mutations have also been reported in breast cancer leading to ligand independent activation of FGFR2. In cell line and xenograft experiments, inhibition/knockdown of FGFR2 results in anti-tumour effects, suggesting the oncogenic role of FGFR2, raising the potential of FGFR2 as a target of therapy in FGFR2 driven cancers.

On ligand stimulation, FGFR3 undergoes dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation, resulting in cell proliferation or differentiation, , through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phospholipase Cg signal transduction pathways. Some FGFR3 mutations are believed to result in ligand-independent activation of the receptor. However, FGFR3 F384L mutation is not associated with activation of FGFR and, in NIH-3T3 cells, it was demonstrated to be devoid of any transforming activity.  In some cases, the possibility of FGFR3 variants being of germline origin, cannot be excluded. The FGFR3 F384L mutation has been reported as a benign/likely benign germline variant in ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/134404/). Clinical correlation is recommended.",

Accumulation of nuclear beta catenin can lead to a tumoral phenotype and oncogenic transformation in a variety of solid tumors. Various oncogenic mutants of beta catenin have been found in different tumor types which alter its degradation, leading to its accumulation and promoting tumor growth. CTNNB1 mutations are particularly common in colorectal carcinomas associated with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer syndrome and wild type APC gene, and are extremely rare in sporadic colorectal cancers. These mutations consist almost entirely of transitions at codons 41 and 45, and result in stabilization of a protein that resists degradation, leading to nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin. Up to 50% of primary colorectal carcinomas with CTNNB1 mutations exhibit microsatellite instability, suggesting that CTNNB1 mutations may be more common in the DNA mismatch repair pathway of tumorigenesis. Microsatellite instability is generally associated with better prognosis when compared to patients with intact mismatch repair pathways. Preclinical studies suggest that CTNNB1 mutations may confer resistance to PI3K-AKT inhibitors in colorectal cancer.",

Cancer-associated alterations in this gene often result in loss of PTEN protein and upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Germline mutations of PTEN lead to inherited hamartoma and Cowden syndrome while somatic mutations are also known to occur in multiple malignancies. PTEN alterations are rare and not well characterized in parathyroid tumors. One study reported loss of heterozygosity of PTEN in 7 of 14 parathyroid carcinomas. PTEN p.G165R variant is a reported pathogenic variant that causes glycine to arginine substitution at codon 165 affecting NH2-terminal phosphatase domain. This variant has been reported previously in endometrial and CNS tumors in COSMIC data base. Functional studies demonstrate that individuals harboring this variant have decreased levels of the functional PTEN protein when compared to wild type controls.

EGFR is involved in cell growth control through its role in the two main intracellular pathways, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- (PI3K-) protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. The over-expression or mutation of EGFR may be responsible for the constitutive activation of these pathways.  In the colorectal cancer, the EGFR has been found to be frequently over expressed, and may be associated with tumor stage and prognosis. In a subset of such patients, the addition of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies to the conventional chemotherapeutic regimens may expand response rates and increase progression-free survival. Somatic EGFR mutations are infrequent in colorectal cancers. The frequency varies from 0.34 to 3.3% in Western population, and from 12% to 22.4% in Asians. R776H is a recurrent mutation in the hinge region of the kinase domain and is known to activate EGFR in a ligand independent manner. In some cases, the possibility of R776H variant being of germline origin, cannot be excluded. The clinicopathologic correlation of EGFR mutations in colorectal cancers continues to be explored.",

        "description": "The receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2 is one of four fibroblast growth factor receptors designated FGFR1-4 that activate FGF signalling upon trans-autophosphorylation of the receptor dimers. Some genetic alterations of FGFR2 lead to aberrant activation of FGFR2 signaling cascades due to the creation of autocrine signaling loop or the release of FGFR2 from autoinhibition.  About 10-16% of primary endometrial cancers harbor activating mutations in FGFR2. These mutations are more frequent in cancers of endometrioid histological subtype compared with serous or clear-cell subtypes.  Gain-of-function mutations in the kinase domain lead to ligand-independent activation of the receptor, whereas mutations in the extracellular ligand-binding domain increase the affinity for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). Both types of mutations have been shown to be potentially oncogenic in endometrial cancer cell lines.  In cell line and xenograft experiments, inhibition/knockdown of FGFR2 results in anti-tumour effects, suggesting the oncogenic role of FGFR2, raising the potential of FGFR2 as a target of therapy in FGFR2 driven cancers.  Therefore, FGFR-pathway inhibition remains potentially promising in this patient population.",

Two types of mutations account for approximately 80-90% of all EGFR mutations: short in-frame deletions in Exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 at codon 858 (L858R). Other less common mutations in exons 18, 20, and 21 are found in 10-20% of EGFR-mutated cases.

The T790M mutation in exon 20 is associated with resistance to some EGFR inhibitors. However, third generation TKI (eg, osimertinib) can specifically target T790M. EGFR exon 18 mutations account for 3.6% of all the EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinomas.  Of these, G719 mutations account for the majority of them and are sensitive to anti-EGFR inhibitors.

In addition, somatic alterations in these genes may occur in some tumor types. TSC1 and TSC2 both are tumor suppressor genes and their inactivation occurs by a classical two-hit mechanism. TSC1 is located on chromosome 9q34 and encodes hamartin. TSC2 is located on chromosome 16p13 and encodes tuberin. Hamartin and tuberin interact with and regulate a variety of proteins. These are negative regulators of the mTOR pathway, which is important for cell proliferation and frequently found activated in tumors. Mutation or deletion of TSC1 or TSC2 is found in 9-16 % of urothelial bladder tumors and up to 3% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas. More than 50% of bladder tumors of all grades and stages show LOH for markers on chromosome 9 and the TSC1 locus at 9q34 is a common critical region of deletion. Therefore, mTOR inhibitors have been identified as potential therapies for TSC1-mutated bladder cancers in some studies. LOH for the TSC1 or TSC2 locus has been described in 22% of 86 human lung cancer specimens. However, TSC1/2 sequence alterations are infrequent in lung and other epithelial malignancies.",

Somatic CDH1 alterations are also found in approximately 30% of all patients with gastric cancers, both diffuse and intestinal types.  CDH1 mutation identification in HDGC families is clinically important to assess the risk of gastric and breast cancers in unaffected relatives.

Mutations in CTNNB1, the gene encoding \u03b2-catenin, tend to impact or even eliminate APC-dependent serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in exon 3, resulting in oncogenic stabilization of the protein. Increased protein within the nuclei serves as a transcriptional factor through binding to the Tcf/Lef family. Mutations in the \u03b2-catenin gene are uncommon in NSCLC occurring in about 1-4% of the cases. Nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin was found to be associated with EGFR mutations, and \u03b2-catenin overexpression was associated with NSCLC cell line resistance to gefitinib. Wnt pathway inhibitors are in preclinical development or have entered early clinical trials. Because high \u03b2-catenin expression has been associated with good outcome rather than with poor outcome in NSCLC patients, it could potentially prove important to target specific downstream \u03b2-catenin functions rather than using agents that could directly suppress \u03b2-catenin levels through upstream targeting of the Wnt pathway.",

PIK3CA is among the most commonly mutated genes in cancer and aberrant activation of PI3K is a transforming event. Somatic mutations in PIK3CA have been found in 1--3% of NSCLC and genetic alteration in PIK3CA have been identified in 7% of lung adenocarcinomas. These mutations typically occur within specific hotspot regions. PIK3CA mutations activate the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway which is downstream from both the EGFR and the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathways. The somatic mutations found thus far in PIK3CA are oncogenic, and the majority of them are clustered within exon 9 and 20 (helical and kinase domains), with three hotspots (E542K, E545K, and H1047R/L).

They are detected less frequently in cholangiocarcinoma (~6%) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (~4%). The predictive and prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutations is unclear and needs further elucidation. Clinical trials targeting PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway inhibitors are available for patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors.",

Approximately 8-15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) harbors BRAF mutations. BRAF G469A mutation in exon 11 is infrequent in CRC and occurs within the kinase domain. The presence of BRAF mutation is significantly associated with right-sided colon cancers and is associated with decreased overall survival. BRAF mutation in a microsatellite unstable colorectal carcinoma indicates that the tumor is probably sporadic and not associated with Lynch syndrome (HNPCC). However, if a BRAF mutation is not detected, the tumor may either be sporadic or Lynch syndrome associated. Detection of BRAF mutations may also be useful in determining patient eligibility for anti-EGFR treatment. Some studies have reported that patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) that harbor BRAF mutations do not respond to anti-EGFR antibody agents (cetuximab or panitumumab) in the chemotherapy-refractory setting.

        "description": "CDH1 on 16q22.1 encodes E-cadherin which functions in intercellular adhesion. E-cadherin is involved in transmitting chemical signals and controlling cell maturation and movement, and acts as a tumor suppressor. A lack of functional E-cadherin impairs cell adhesion and increases the likelihood of invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of invasive breast cancers and is characterized by loss of E-cadherin expression due to mutations, loss of heterozygosity and hypermethylation. Germline CDH1 mutations have been found to cause a familial cancer disorder called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). CDH1 mutation identification in HDGC families has important clinical implications for gastric and breast cancers risk assessment in unaffected family members. The estimated risk for invasive lobular carcinoma in females with germline CDH1 mutations is approximately 40% by age 80 years. Prognostic and therapeutic implications of this alteration remain to be fully elucidated. The 50 gene panel hotspot assay cannot distinguish between germline or somatic (acquired) variants. Correlation with other clinical and lab findings, including genetic counseling, may be helpful, if clinically indicated.",

APC promotes rapid degradation of beta-catenin and participates in Wnt signaling as a negative regulator. APC is also involved in other processes including cell migration, cell adhesion, transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Germline defects in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant pre-malignant disease that usually progresses to malignancy. Disease-associated mutations tend to be clustered in a small region designated the mutation cluster region (MCR) and result in a truncated protein product. Pancreatic cancer is considered a low risk cancer, though it is observed in FAP families with higher incidence than the general populations. Somatic APC mutations have been reported in ~1% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). Codon I1307 lies within a regulatory region of the APC protein mediated by ubiquitination. APC I1307K is associated with increased colorectal cancer risk by making the gene unstable and prone to acquire mutations during normal cell division. The germline APC I1307K gene mutation is most commonly found in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.  Therefore, routine colorectal screening is very important in these individuals.  The prognostic and therapeutic implications of APC mutations in PDAC remain to be fully elucidated. Correlation with other clinical and lab findings is recommended.",

        "description": "The APC gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway. APC promotes rapid degradation of beta-catenin and participates in Wnt signaling as a negative regulator. APC is also involved in other processes including cell migration, cell adhesion, transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Germline defects in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant pre-malignant disease that usually progresses to malignancy. Disease-associated mutations tend to be clustered in a small region designated the mutation cluster region (MCR) and result in a truncated protein product. Somatic mutations in this gene may be observed in colorectal cancer (CRC), stomach cancer and desmoid tumors. Although APC mutations have been reported in ~2% of ovarian serous adenocarcinomas, further studies are needed to explore the clinical value of these mutations in ovarian cancers. Results should be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings.",

KRAS can harbor oncogenic mutations that yield a constitutively active protein. Such mutations are found in approximately 30% to 50% of metastatic colorectal tumors and are common in other tumor types. Mutations in the KRAS gene may indicate poor prognosis and poor drug response with therapies targeted to EGFR. The absence of a KRAS mutation predicts a greater likelihood of response to EGFR-targeted therapies and improved survival with such treatment. The relevant KRAS mutation is in one of five codons (12 13, 61, 117 or 146). The presence of KRAS mutations in codon 12, 13 or 61 is associated with a high likelihood of resistance to therapies targeting EGFR.

Mutations involving residue R108 have been reported in GBM, frequently occurring with other EGFR mutations at amino acids A289, P596, and G598. In vitro studies have shown that R108K mutation leads to increased ligand-binding affinity and shows anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenic potential when stably expressed in NIH-3T3 cells. The predictive and prognostic significance of this mutation at R108 needs further elucidation. Correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is recommended.",

Accumulation of nuclear beta catenin can lead to a tumoral phenotype and oncogenic transformation in a variety of solid tumors. Various oncogenic mutants of beta catenin have been found in different tumor types which alter its degradation, leading to its accumulation and promoting tumor growth. Alterations in genes coding for members of the APC/b (beta)-catenin pathway have been identified in 20--25% of acinar cell carcinomas. These included inactivating mutations in APC as well as activating mutations in CTNNB1. CTNNB1 alterations have been identified in approximately 9% of pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas. CTNNB1 G34E is a rare mutation and does not lie within any known functional domains of the CTNNB1 protein. One study has shown that this mutation results in resistance to degradation, leading to increased pathway activation. Preclinical studies in CTNNB1 mutated solid tumors are underway. The full clinicopathological significance of CTNNB1 G34E remains to be further elucidated in pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma.",

        "description": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a cell surface receptor belonging to the ErbB family tyrosine kinase receptors. EGFR is involved in cell growth control through its role in the two main intracellular pathways, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- (PI3K-) protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. The over-expression or mutation of EGFR may be responsible for the constitutive activation of these pathways. In colorectal cancer, EGFR has been found to be frequently over expressed, and may be associated with tumor stage and prognosis. Somatic EGFR mutations are infrequent in colorectal cancers. The frequency of EGFR mutations in colorectal cancer varies from 0.34 to 3.3% in Western population, and from 12% to 22.4% in Asians. In a subset of patients with EGFR mutations in colorectal cancer, the addition of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies to the conventional chemotherapeutic regimens may expand response rates and increase progression-free survival. EGFR V765M lies within the protein kinase domain of the protein. In lung cancer, the V765M has been reported as a sensitizing mutation to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The correlation of EGFR gene mutations with clinicopathologic characteristics in colorectal cancers continues to be explored.",

APC promotes rapid degradation of beta-catenin and participates in Wnt signaling as a negative regulator. APC is also involved in other processes including cell migration, cell adhesion, transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Germline defects in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant pre-malignant disease that usually progresses to malignancy. Disease-associated mutations tend to be clustered in a small region designated as the mutation cluster region (MCR) and result in a truncated protein product. A study of APC gene mutations in gastric carcinomas did not find an obvious relationship between the APC mutation and tumor size, depth of invasion, node metastasis or clinical stages, indicating a limited role of the APC mutation in predicting prognosis of gastric carcinomas. APC mutations were significantly more frequent in intestinal type gastric cancers as compared with diffuse type gastric cancers, suggesting that APC gene is not only a predisposing gene in colorectal cancer but also a predisposing gene in intestinal type of gastric cancer.",

APC promotes rapid degradation of beta-catenin and participates in Wnt signaling as a negative regulator. APC is also involved in other processes including cell migration, cell adhesion, transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Germline defects in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant pre-malignant disease that usually progresses to malignancy. Disease-associated mutations tend to be clustered in a small region designated the mutation cluster region (MCR) and result in a truncated protein product. Somatic APC mutations have been reported in less than 1% of breast invasive ductal carcinoma. Codon I1307 lies within a regulatory region of the APC protein mediated by ubiquitination. Germline APC I1307K is associated with increased colorectal cancer risk by making the gene unstable and prone to acquire mutations during normal cell division. The germline APC I1307K gene mutation is most commonly found in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Therefore, routine colorectal screening is very important in these individuals. The prognostic and therapeutic implications of APC mutations in breast carcinoma remain to be fully elucidated. Correlation with other clinical and lab findings is recommended",

BRAF mutation frequencies are highly controversial in biliary tract cancers ranging from 0 to 33% for BRAF V600E. As most studies with high BRAF mutation rates were performed on European cohorts, this has raised the question of whether these discordant results represent a regional difference in the genetics of biliary tract cancer. In large cohort of biliary tract cancers including intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder, BRAF V600E mutations were only rarely found in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and were not identified in any cases of gallbladder adenocarcinoma.

Approximately 8--15% of colorectal cancer (CRC) harbors BRAF mutations. BRAF G469V mutation in exon 11 is infrequent in CRC and occurs within the kinase domain. The presence of BRAF mutation is significantly associated with right-sided colon cancers and is associated with decreased overall survival. BRAF mutation in a microsatellite unstable colorectal carcinoma indicates that the tumor is probably sporadic and not associated with Lynch syndrome (HNPCC). However, if a BRAF mutation is not detected, the tumor may either be sporadic or Lynch syndrome associated. Detection of BRAF mutations may also be useful in determining patient eligibility for anti-EGFR treatment. Some studies have reported that patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) that harbor BRAF mutations do not respond to anti-EGFR antibody agents (cetuximab or panitumumab) in the chemotherapy-refractory setting.

KRAS can harbor oncogenic mutations that yield a constitutively active protein. Such mutations are found in approximately 30% to 60% of small intestine adenocarcinomas and are common in other tumor types. The relevant KRAS mutation is in one of five codons (12 13, 61, 117 or 146). KRAS mutations in small intestine tumors are associated with higher pT classification and more frequent pancreatic invasion. The effect of KRAS mutations on drug therapy has not been well established in the literature, however it has been extensively studied in colorectal adenocarcinoma. Mutations in the KRAS gene may indicate poor prognosis and poor drug response with therapies targeted to EGFR in colon cancer, and the absence of a KRAS mutation predicts a greater likelihood of response to EGFR-targeted therapies and improved survival with such treatment. The presence of KRAS mutations in codon 12, 13 or 61 is associated with a high likelihood of resistance to therapies targeting EGFR in colon cancer. In addition, mutations at codons 117 and 146 may also be associated with reduced response to EGFR-targeted therapies in colon cancer.

FBXW7 loss of function mutations have been described in many types of adenocarcinoma including colon, bladder and lung. FBXW7 mutations are present in approximately 7% of urothelial carcinomas. Preclinical data have suggested that inactivating mutations of FBXW7 could predict sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. However, this particular variant (H500Y) has not been characterized in the scientific literature. Therefore, the effect on protein function is unknown. Clinical correlation is recommended.",

ATM is part of many signalling networks, including cell metabolism and growth, oxidative stress, and chromatin remodelling, all of which can affect cancer progression. Although ATM is considered to be a tumour suppressor, ATM signaling may be advantageous to cancer cells in some settings, particularly in resistance to radio- and chemotherapeutic treatment. For this reason, the use of ATM inhibitors in cancer therapy is under exploration. Genetic alterations in ATM have been reported in ~15% of urothelial carcinomas.

        "description": "TP53 encodes p53, a tumor suppressor protein that consists of transactivation domain, proline-rich domain, DNA-binding domain, oligomerization domain, and regulatory domain. p53 responds to diverse cellular stresses to maintain genomic stability and to induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair and metabolic changes. TP53 mutations represent an important mechanism of resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents.  Somatic TP53 mutations are found in a variety of cancers with various frequencies depending on cancer type; overall, TP53 is mutated in over one-half of human cancers. Missense mutations were the most frequent (~70-80%), followed by frameshift and nonsense mutations.  Most TP53 mutations are clustered in the DNA-binding domain encompassing exons 5 and 8. These mutations either directly disrupt the DNA-binding domain of TP53 or cause conformational changes of the TP53 protein, thus leading to severely impaired TP53 function. Overall in myeloid malignancies, TP53 mutations are found in 5% to 15% of de novo MDS and AML but 20% of myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated del(5q) and ~50% of MDS/AML with complex karyotype. TP53 mutations are also more frequent in therapy-associated myeloid neoplasm (21-38%) compared to de novo MDS and AML.   TP53 mutations are also found in 8% of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, and less than 5% in myeloproliferative neoplasms (ET, PV and PMF) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. TP53 mutations are independently associated with a poor prognosis in myelodysplastic syndrome (NCCN Guidelines for Myelodysplastic Syndromes) and is a poor risk factor in AML (NCCN Guildelines for AML). TP53 mutations are also associated with resistance to lenalidomide or relapse during lenalidomide treatment.   TP53 mutations are independently associated with unfavorable outcomes and shorter survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia, but an increased response to decitabine in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.",

Rare insertion and deletion mutations leading to premature translation termination in NFE2 were found in 2% of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).  NFE2 mutatoins appear to be enriched in isolated myeloid sarcomas (MS). Of the six investigated cases of MS without previous or concurrent AML in the bone marrow, 4 (67%) harbored mutations in NFE2, 3 of which were missense and 1 of which was frameshift.  In addition, NFE2 is overexpressed in the majority of patients with MPNs. In murine models, over-expression of NFE2 caused an MPN phenotype with spontaneous leukemic transformation, supporting a direct role of NFE2 in the pathogenesis of MPN.  Over-expression of NFE2 in MPN may be attributed to histone H3Y41 phosphorylation by V617F-mutated JAK2 and transcriptional activation of NFE2 by JMJD1C in a positive feedback loop.",

It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Cancer-associated alterations in this gene often result in loss of PTEN protein and upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. PTEN mutations have been reported in 15% of anaplastic thyroid cancer. Germline mutations of PTEN lead to inherited hamartoma and Cowden syndrome. Patients with Cowden syndrome have an increased risk of developing epithelial thyroid cancer, follicular carcinoma being the most common, of up to 10% compared to <1% in the general population. The PTEN I101T has been observed in a variety of cancer types. One study identified the PTEN I101T variant in 1 out of 172 patients with germ line PTEN mutations. Of note, an in vitro studied observed that the PTEN I101T variant reduced the half-life of PTEN as well as significantly reduced its activity.

E-cadherin is involved in transmitting chemical signals and controlling cell maturation and movement, and acts as a tumor suppressor. A lack of functional E-cadherin impairs cell adhesion and increases the likelihood of invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. CDH1 is altered by mutation or deletion in various cancers and loss of E-cadherin has been demonstrated in a variety of sporadic cancer types including breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophageal cancer. Along with point mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation of the CDH1 promoter has been associated with the loss of E-cadherin gene expression during cancer progression. Individuals with a germline CDH1 mutation have an increased risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer and breast cancer. More than 100 different pathogenic germline mutations are distributed throughout the CDH1 gene including splice-site sequences and have been found to cause a familial cancer disorder called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Somatic CDH1 alterations are also found in approximately 30% of all patients with gastric cancers, both diffuse and intestinal types. Genetic alterations of CDH1 have been identified in 4% of colorectal adenocarcinomas.

It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Approximately 20-30% of colorectal carcinomas involve biallelic inactivation of PTEN through a combination of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The R15I missense mutation falls within the PIP2 binding motif in the phosphatase domain of PTEN, which involves residues 6-15.

Although the functional consequence of KDR K270N has not been characterized, it has been reported previously as a somatic variant in in colorectal carcinomas.

Germline mutations in SMAD4 have been associated with juvenile polyposis syndrome. SMAD4 is mutated in one third of colorectal cancer and half of pancreatic tumors. Genetic alterations in SMAD4 have been identified in 33% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. SMAD4 inactivation by allelic deletion or mutation mainly occurs in late stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and is associated with poorer prognosis. SMAD4 D351G lies at a hotspot residue within the MH2 domain of the Smad4 protein (UniProt.org). D351G has been identified in sequencing studies, but has not been biochemically characterized and therefore, its effect on Smad4 protein function is unknown. The SMAD4 D351H variant has been described in human colorectal cancer cell lines and reported as likely oncogenic, suggesting that the D351G variant is also likely to be oncogenic. SMAD4 loss has been found to increase resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent 5'-fluorouracil.",

PIK3CA is among the most commonly mutated genes in cancer and aberrant activation of PI3K is a transforming event. Somatic mutations in PIK3CA have been found in 1--3% of NSCLC and genetic alteration in PIK3CA have been identified in 7% of lung adenocarcinomas. These mutations typically occur within specific hotspot regions. PIK3CA mutations appear to be more common in squamous cell histology compared to adenocarcinoma and can occur with or without a history of smoking. PIK3CA mutations can co-occur with EGFR mutations and PIK3CA mutations have been detected in a small percentage (approximately 5%) of EGFR-mutated lung cancers with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy.

Gain-of-function mutations of the c-kit gene have been identified that produce ligand-independent activation of c-kit and cell proliferation. Some of these mutations appear causative in the pathogenesis of adult mastocytosis and most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Activating KIT mutations occur in 80 - 90% of GISTs and several small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting KIT that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration with the efficacy of each TKI strongly depending on the location of the activating KIT mutation. c-kit receptor and its ligand have been demonstrated in human colon cancer cell lines. Some studies have shown high frequency of c-Kit overexpression in stage II colon cancer patients (59.3%) with significant correlation between c-Kit overexpression and reduced disease free survival. However, other studies failed to demonstrate c-kit expression in a significant number of colorectal cancers suggesting that c-kit kinase activation is not a prominent pathogenetic feature of colorectal cancers. The role of c-Kit continues to be studied in colon cancers. The KIT D52N mutation likely represent an oncogenic gain of function mutation.",

MET is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface receptor that leads to the activation of several downstream intracellular pathways which promote cellular growth and proliferation, motility, migration and angiogenesis. Dysregulation of MET via gene amplification, germline or somatic mutations or receptor overexpression has been observed in a variety of epithelial cancers, including breast prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, renal papillary carcinoma, hepatocellular and gastric carcinomas. Genetic alterations in MET have been identified in 0.4% of thyroid carcinomas. The prognostic and predictive significance of MET mutations in thyroid cancer is not clear and correlation with other clinical and laboratory findings is necessary. M362T has been identified in the scientific literature, but has not been biochemically characterized and therefore, its effect on protein function is unknown.

        "description": "CDH1 on 16q22.1 encodes E-cadherin which functions in intercellular adhesion. E-cadherin is involved in transmitting chemical signals and controlling cell maturation and movement, and acts as a tumor suppressor. A lack of functional E-cadherin impairs cell adhesion and increases the likelihood of invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. CDH1 is altered by mutation or deletion in various cancers and loss of E-cadherin has been demonstrated in a variety of sporadic cancer types including breast cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and esophageal cancer. Along with point mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH), epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation of the CDH1 promoter has been associated with the loss of E-cadherin gene expression during cancer progression. Individuals with a germline CDH1 mutation have an increased risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer and breast cancer. More than 100 different pathogenic germline mutations are distributed throughout the CDH1 gene including splice-site sequences and have been found to cause a familial cancer disorder called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). Somatic CDH1 alterations are also found in approximately 30% of all patients with gastric cancers, both diffuse and intestinal types. Genetic alterations of CDH1 have been identified in 4% of colorectal adenocarcinomas. CDH1 D400V lies within the Cadherin domain 3 of the Cdh1 protein (UniProt.org).

ATM is part of many signaling networks, including cell metabolism and growth, oxidative stress, and chromatin remodeling, all of which can affect cancer progression. Although ATM is considered to be a tumor suppressor, ATM signaling may be advantageous to cancer cells in some settings, particularly in resistance to radio- and chemotherapeutic treatment. Germline ATM mutations are the defining feature of ataxia telangiectasia syndrome, a rare, neurodegenerative, autosomal disorder. ATM somatic mutations are associated with endometrial, colon, pancreatic, breast cancers and urothelial cancers. ATM-mutant cancers are increasingly sensitive to DNA damaging agents due to deficits in DNA repair pathways, and ATM loss may result in better response to checkpoint inhibition in some cancers. For this reason, the use of ATM inhibitors in cancer therapy is under exploration. Genetic alterations of ATM have been identified in 5% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. ATM F858L has been identified in the scientific literature, but has not been biochemically characterized and therefore, its effect on ATM protein function is unknown.

Somatic gain-of-function mutations in CTNNB1 result in aberrant accumulation of the b-catenin protein and are prevalent in a wide range of solid tumors, including uterine/endometrial carcinoma, ovarian, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma, among others. CTNNB1 mutations are particularly common in colorectal carcinomas associated with hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer syndrome and wild type APC gene, and are extremely rare in sporadic colorectal cancers. CTNNB1 is altered in 2.9% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The CTNNB1 T41A mutation is known to be oncogenic. Preclinical studies suggest that CTNNB1 mutations may confer resistance to PI3K-AKT inhibitors in colorectal cancer. Cancers with CTNNB1 mutations are presumed to be resistant to pharmacologic inhibition of upstream components of the WNT pathway, instead requiring direct inhibition of b-catenin function. The role of CTNNB1 mutations in pancreatic adenocarcinomas requires further elucidation.",

APC promotes rapid degradation of beta-catenin and participates in Wnt signaling as a negative regulator. APC is also involved in other processes including cell migration, cell adhesion, transcriptional activation and apoptosis. Germline defects in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant pre-malignant disease that usually progresses to malignancy. Disease-associated mutations tend to be clustered in a small region designated the mutation cluster region (MCR) and result in a truncated protein product. Codon I1307 lies within a regulatory region of the APC protein mediated by ubiquitination. Germline APC I1307K is associated with increased colorectal cancer risk by making the gene unstable and prone to acquire mutations during normal cell division. The germline APC I1307K gene mutation is most commonly found in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Therefore, routine colorectal screening is very important in these individuals. One study showed that males had significantly increased I1307K carrier prevalence in lung, urologic, pancreatic, and skin cancers. APC somatic mutations are found 4% of lung adenocarcinomas. The I1307K has not been reported as a somatic mutation in lung adenocarcinomas to date. The prognostic and therapeutic implications of somatic APC mutations in lung adenocarcinomas remain to be fully elucidated. Correlation with other clinical and lab findings is recommended.",

The active, hypophosphorylated form of the protein binds transcription factor E2F1. Inactivation of RB1 and loss of RB1 tumor suppressor function has been identified in many early stage cancers. RB1 alterations are found in approximately 8% of non-small cell lung cancers. RB1 S576fs*34 results in early truncation of the RB1 protein and presumably loss of function. The predictive and prognostic significance of RB1 mutations in lung non-small cell carcinoma is undergoing further investigation. It has been suggested that patients with RB1-deficient tumors do not respond to cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors; however, the clinical implication of the loss of a single copy of RB1, as in this patient's case, remains to be fully elucidated.

Two types of mutations account for approximately 80-90% of all EGFR mutations: short in-frame deletions in Exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 at codon 858 (L858R). Other less common mutations in exons 18, 20, and 21 are found in 10-20% of EGFR-mutated cases. EGFR exon19 deletions, exon 21 L858R and Exon 18 mutations correlate strongly with sensitivity to specific EGFR inhibitors, and the response rate to therapy with TKIs has been reported to be up to 80% in such cases. The T790M mutation in exon 20 is associated with resistance to some EGFR inhibitors. However, third generation TKI (eg, osimertinib) can specifically target T790M. \nCompound (dual) mutations in EGFR have been previously reported in lung adenocarcinoma and typically include a strong activating mutation combined with a weaker activating mutation. These cases appear to respond well to the EGFR targeted therapies. Mutations at E709 in exon 18 often occur together with other mutations in EGFR.

Approximately 2% of colonic adenocarcinomas harbor somatic mutations in the PTPN11 gene. The E76K variant of PTPN11 has been found to be oncogenic in gliomas, but their prognostic and therapeutic significance in colonic adenocarcinomas remains to be fully elucidated (https://oncokb.org/#/gene/PTPN11/alteration/E76K).",

        "description": "Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are present in approximately 80% of the lung adenocarcinomas that respond to first and second generation EGFR inhibitors (eg, gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib). Two types of mutations account for approximately 80-90% of all EGFR mutations: short in-frame deletions in Exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 at codon 858 (L858R). Other less common mutations in exons 18, 20, and 21 are found in 10-20% of EGFR-mutated cases. EGFR Exon 19 deletions, EGFR Exon 21 L858R and EGFR Exon 18 G719 mutations correlate strongly with sensitivity to specific EGFR inhibitors and the response rate to therapy with TKIs has been reported to be up to 80% in such cases. The T790M mutation in exon 20 is associated with resistance to some EGFR inhibitors. However, third generation TKI (eg, osimertinib) can specifically target T790M. EGFR R108K (C.323G>A) is a rare missense mutation in Exon 3. In a study of 1006 lung carcinomas, R108K mutation was found concomitantly with other EGFR mutations - most notably p.L858R (Illei et.al). However, its prognostic and therapeutic significance remains to be fully elucidated.",

Somatic gain-of-function mutations in CTNNB1 result in aberrant accumulation of the b-catenin protein and are prevalent in a wide range of solid tumors, including endometrial carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma, among others. Genetic alterations in CTNNB1 have been identified in 4% of non-small cell lung cancers. The CTNNB1 S437F mutation has been reported as pathogenic in lung adenocarcinoma, but no real progress has been made in targeting oncogenic mutant forms of CTNNB1 in lung cancer. However, CTNNB1 mutation-positive cancers are presumed to be resistant to pharmacologic inhibition of upstream components of the WNT pathway, instead requiring direct inhibition of b-catenin function. In one study pharmacological inhibition of b-catenin suppressed EGFR-L858R/T790M mutated lung tumor and genetic deletion of the b-catenin gene dramatically reduced lung tumor formation in transgenic mice, suggesting that b-catenin plays an essential role in lung tumorigenesis and that targeting the b-catenin pathway may provide novel strategies to prevent lung cancer development or overcome resistance to EGFR TKIs. These results should be interpreted in the clinical context.",

These tumors have a poor prognosis. The H3K27M alteration, which is characteristically heterozygous, leads to a decrease in overall H3K27me3 levels through dysregulation of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and a concurrent increase in H3K27 acetylation levels.

Two types of mutations account for approximately 80-90% of all EGFR mutations: short in-frame deletions in Exon 19 and a point mutation in exon 21 at codon 858 (L858R). Other less common mutations in exons 18, 20, and 21 are found in 10-20% of EGFR-mutated cases.  Exon 20 mutations are more commonly associated with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but may respond to third generation TKI (eg, osimertinib). This EGFR variant (G796S) lies within the tyrosine kinase domain and has been reported in rare cases of lung adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck and prostate adenocarcinoma.

Loss of PTEN is most commonly due to promoter hypermethylation, while homozygous \ndeletion and nonsense mutations with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) may also occur. PTEN \nmutations may occur in multiple exons. Somatic mutations in PTEN have been found in 4-8% of \nnon-small cell carcinomas (NSCLC) including adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. In \npreclinical studies, PTEN loss is associated with decreased sensitivity of EGFR mutant lung \ntumors to EGFR TKIs. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in PTEN loss are \n being explored. The PTENI101T has been observed in a variety of cancer types, most frequently \ngliomas, and has been predicted to be pathogenic.

        "description": "The APC gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway. APC promotes rapid degradation of beta-catenin and participates in Wnt signaling as a negative regulator. Germline defects in this gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant pre-malignant disease that usually progresses to malignancy. Somatic mutations in APC have been reported in 4% of lung adenocarcinomas, the prognostic and therapeutic implications of which remain to be fully elucidated. APC K1454E lies within the beta-catenin binding and down-regulation region of the Apc protein. K1454E suppresses beta-catenin mediated transcription at a level similar to wild-type Apc in a cell culture assay and therefore, is predicted to have no effect on Apc protein function. This variant has also been reported as a germline variant in prior studies and reported in ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/RCV000200964/) as likely benign.",
