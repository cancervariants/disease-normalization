According to the level of differentiation of the tissues which comprise the tumor, teratomas are classified as mature or immature. Mature teratomas are composed of well differentiated, adult-type tissues. Immature teratomas are composed of immature, fetal-type tissues. Testicular teratomas in children follow a benign clinical course. Mature ovarian teratomas without a fetal-type component have an excellent outcome.

Common leukemias include acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

name: neuroblastoma
def: "Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common solid, extracranial childhood tumor. It is an aggressive pediatric cancer that originates from neural crest tissues of the sympathetic nervous system." [PMID:32903387]
comment: NB is a disease of the sympaticoadrenal lineage of the neural crest, with tumors forming anywhere in the sympathetic nervous system. The tumors most commonly arise in the abdomen (65%), however, they also occur in the neck, chest, and pelvis. Approximately 50% of patients present with evidence of metastasis. Frequent metastasis sites include cortical bone, bone marrow, liver, and lymph nodes. The most common genetic change is MYCN amplification, which occurs in approximately 20% of patients, and is strongly correlated with advanced stage NB. Additionally, deletions of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) are found in 25–35% of patients and can be correlated with MYCN amplification. Outside of MYC linked changes, allelic loss of 11q is present in 35–45% of patients and is also associated with high-risk disease features.
