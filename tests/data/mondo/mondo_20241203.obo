It occurs in the testis, ovary, and extragonadal sites including central nervous system, mediastinum, lung, and stomach. According to the level of differentiation of the tissues which comprise the tumor, teratomas are classified as mature or immature. Mature teratomas are composed of well differentiated, adult-type tissues. Immature teratomas are composed of immature, fetal-type tissues. Testicular teratomas in children follow a benign clinical course. Mature ovarian teratomas without a fetal-type component have an excellent outcome. The prognosis of immature ovarian teratomas is related to the grade and stage of the tumor." [NCIT:C3403]

Common leukemias include acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

def: "Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common solid, extracranial childhood tumor. It is an aggressive pediatric cancer that originates from neural crest tissues of the sympathetic nervous system." [PMID:32903387]
comment: NB is a disease of the sympaticoadrenal lineage of the neural crest, with tumors forming anywhere in the sympathetic nervous system. The tumors most commonly arise in the abdomen (65%), however, they also occur in the neck, chest, and pelvis. Approximately 50% of patients present with evidence of metastasis. Frequent metastasis sites include cortical bone, bone marrow, liver, and lymph nodes. The most common genetic change is MYCN amplification, which occurs in approximately 20% of patients, and is strongly correlated with advanced stage NB. Additionally, deletions of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) are found in 25–35% of patients and can be correlated with MYCN amplification. Outside of MYC linked changes, allelic loss of 11q is present in 35–45% of patients and is also associated with high-risk disease features.

The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P. Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other." xsd:string

It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
